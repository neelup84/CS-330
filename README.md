How do I approach designing software?
OpenGL is one of the exciting courses I have ever learned. In the first week of the course, I had no clue what I would learn in this course. I thought it was probably related to some graphics.When designing the software, I followed the rubrics and guidelines thoroughly and got an idea to build my project. So, I started developing the code three weeks before the submission date to make changes and edits. My strategy is experimental and prior coding experience. Later, I learned the definition that it is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics, and it is a graphic API. 

 How do I approach developing programs?
The feedback for the other assignments works for me. After receiving feedback, I have made improvements to my final project.
I used a plane in several assignments, and I changed the plane as a deck for my final project: I decided to add more effects to the scene. So, my final project, the 3D scene, is a wooden deck and sky in the night with some starts. After many experiments with my code and taking the help of resources, I designed this 3D scene. 
I used Render API: VBO/VAO
Shader creation, compilation, linking, setting uniform, and the shader class handles the manual
binding render API. The pointers are automated through the APT class to the object VBO/VAO. It would help if you created a directory with GLSL code files (this would be the equivalent of passing the shader src in the form of a string, but the shader class handles that). Next, we need to initialize, compile, and link it to provide the file paths to the GLSL code on initialization. Finally, predefined data types for uniforms can be set, and a binding method is provided. I tried to use Phong lighting in my scene, but I am unsure how successful I am. 

 How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I have always been passionate about working in the field of IT. I am currently working as a full-time Information Security Analyst and working with a lot of automation using power shell and python, and so coding is very helpful to me in this course. In addition, earlier courses, computer science projects, and work experience helped me reach my goals.
